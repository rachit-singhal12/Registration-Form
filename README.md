# Registration-Form
This project is being conducted as part of an internship program in full stack web developement provided by Bharat Intern

The code includes HTML, CSS, and Node.js scripts to create a user registration form and store user information in a MongoDB database.

HTML: Provides a simple form for users to enter their name, email, and password.
CSS: Styles the form to make it visually appealing.
Node.js: Sets up an Express.js server to handle form submissions. It connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, defines a user schema, and saves user data to the database upon form submission.

The server-side code includes routes to serve the HTML form and handle form submissions. Upon successful registration, the server responds with a success message, and in case of errors, it sends an appropriate error message.
